# Snapmaker2Postprocessor

## Overview
This project provides a postprocessor for the [Path Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Workbench) of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) compatible with the CNC module of [Snapmaker 2.0](https://snapmaker.com) machines.

It converts FreeCAD internal GCODE generated by the Path Workbench into GCODE suitable for Snapmaker 2.0 machines.
Its functions cover:
- Snapmaker CNC commands
- tool change between operations (by inserting a HMI pause (M76))
- drilling (by converting G81-G83 commands)
- thumbnail generation for HMI
- rapid moves (speed is not added by FreeCAD to GCODE)

## Usage
Move the `Snapmaker_2_CNC_post.py` file to the FreeCAD macros directory. It should appear within the list of postprocessors of the Path workbench. 

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/clsergent/Snapmaker2Postprocessor/wiki) if you need more information.

Refer to [FreeCAD documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Post) on how to use a postprocessor.


## Limitations
This postprocessor has been tested on FreeCAD v0.21. Generated GCODE has been tested on a SnapMaker 2 A350 / A250. It *should* work on any other Snapmaker 2.0 (A150, A250, A250T, A350T), and *may* work on other Snapamker machines, but with no warranty. If you encounter any bug, please open an issue. 

This postprocessor fails to process paths to gcode under FreeCAD v0.21 that utilize the dressup tag functionality. It may work with other dressup options but these have not been tested at this point. Processing is successful on normal paths.

## Credits
Parts of this postprocessor have been inspired by the Marlin postprocessor shipped along with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org).
